# JChisholm204's dotfiles
This repo contains the bulk of the dotfiles I use on a daily basis.

## Alacritty
Alacritty is my terminal of choice.
The Alacritty setup also includes references to the nerdfonts I like to use.

## Git
The Git config contains some basic helper scripts and such I like to use on my machines.
The Git configuration was largely stolen from various sources, so check the readme in the git folder for more information.

## Gnome
A backup of my Gnome configuration.
Most of this configuration is setting key binds similar to those used in many Hyprland configs.

## SSH
Probably a security vulnerability to have this here...
Most people won't want this anyway..

## TMUX
My TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer) configuration.
Uses Vim keybindings and CTRL+SPACE as the prefix key.
This config also includes tmux restore to restart sessions after power loss.

## NeoVim
Currently in another repository.
Thus far I have kept this separate for... Actually I don't know why anymore.
Go check it out at [https://github.com/Jchisholm204/neovim](https://github.com/Jchisholm204/neovim).

## ZSH
The most basic OhMyZsh configuration one could possibly think of.
Terminals should be KISS 'ed' (Keep It Stupid Simple) anyway.

## Install Script
Creates a 'semi' automatic install experience.

### Known Issues
- Does not install Starship - Need to install starship separately
